							<p><span class = "featured">Featured course problem (Can you beat the odds?)</span>: The probability of the ball landing on black after a standard American Roulette wheel is spun is 18/38 = 9/19 &approx; 47.37%.  You start with 400 Molloy points.  You win 100 points if the ball lands on black and lose 100 if it lands on red or green.  If you play until you have 500 (net gain of 100) or lose all 400 points, how likely are you to win those points?</p>
							<p>We can write a program to approximate this probability by simulating wheel spins for 100,000 attempts.  How likely are you to go up by 100 points?  The answer may surprise you, but be careful with this strategy because when you lose, you lose all of your points!</p>
